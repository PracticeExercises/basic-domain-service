# Basic Domain Service

An example domain service written in C#. Developed with Visual Studio 2017 and .NET 4.6.1.

Your tasks:
 * clone the solution to your local machine
 * run the API project locally and check the endpoints
 * prepare a test plan with test cases for this domain service
 * create an automated test suite for this solution to be used in a **CI Server** and run every build
 * zip up the test suite together with the written down test plan and e-mail them back

The test suite has to run on a **Windows environment**. The choice of tools is yours.

The project uses https://fixer.io to pull currency rates.  
The project uses https://swagger.io to present the endpoints.  
The project is configured to use swagger at http://localhost:6500/swagger.  

Thank you and good luck,
