# Basic Domain Service

Example domain service written in C#.

Start the **BasicDomainService.Api** project and head over to http://localhost:6500/swagger/ui/index to check the endpoints.

Developed in Visual Studio 2017 and .NET 4.6.1.

This project uses https://fixer.io to pull currency rates.

Your tasks:
 * clone the solution to your local machine
 * run the API project locally and check the endpoints
 * prepare a test plan with test cases for this domain service
 * create an automated test suite for this solution to be used on TFS
 * zip up the test suite together with the written down test plan and e-mail them back

The test suite has to run on a Windows environment. The choice of tools is yours.

Thank you and good luck
